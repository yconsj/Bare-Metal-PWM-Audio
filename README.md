# STM32F103RB Bare-Metal Development

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **bare-metal development** for the **STM32F103RB** microcontroller. The goal is to interact directly with hardware using the **ARM Cortex-M3** architecture, without relying on external frameworks like STM32CubeMX or HAL. The project focuses on configuring **GPIO**, generating **PWM** signals, and running basic applications using **GCC** and **OpenOCD**.

## Goals
- Create linker script from scratch.
- **Bare-metal** development using **VS Code** and **GCC**.
- Generate **PWM audio** using timers.
- Control **GPIO** pins to interact with external hardware (e.g., LED).
- Directly manipulate hardware registers with no external libraries.
